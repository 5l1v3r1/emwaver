# emwaver
This project is currently in development. A first firmware version and Android app will be available as soon as late July 2023.

The goal of this device is to emulate all functionality of the Flipper Zero Sub-1GHz block, on a build that costs less than $10 to manufacture as a consumer. It will be able to (at least):
- record signals and replay them at a chosen frequency;
- easily load signals and send them (this is even easier because of running on an Android app)
- spectrum analyzer (analyse the frequency of a remote or signal);
- the first version of this device will only work on 433/315 MHZ bands.

This project is on halt, but development will resume on 28/06/2023. Stay tuned
